# Empirical Velocity Distribution of Dark Matter
### Work published as arXiv:1708.XXXXX, by Jonah-Herzog-Arbeitman, Mariangela Lisanti, and Lina Necib

In our paper, we empirically derive the velocity distribution of dark matter based on that of metal poor stars. We perform various cuts on these stars:

* Quality cuts as discussed in the paper
* abs(z)>1.5 kpc
* Either [Fe/H] <-1.5 or [Fe/H]<-1.8.

We find two velocity distributions of these metal poor stars, one for each of the [Fe/H] cuts. The files are in this repository.
